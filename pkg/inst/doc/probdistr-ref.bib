	Abstract = {The family of continuous type distributions such
                  that the logarithm of the probability (density)
                  function is a hyperbola (or, in several dimensions,
                  a hyperboloid) is introduced and investigated. It
                  is, among other things, shown that a distribution of
                  this kind is a mixture of normal distributions. As
                  to applications, the paper focuses on the mass-size
                  distribution of aeolian sand deposits, with
                  particular reference to the findings of
                  R. A. Bagnold. The distribution family seems,
                  however, to be of some potential usefulness in other
                  concrete contexts too.},
